1. You must be logged in to the OpenLab to join a Project, so after logging in, go to the <strong>Project Profile</strong> of the Project you want to join.  (Read more about how to <a title="Finding a Project" href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/finding-a-project/">find a Project</a>.)

2. If the Project is public, click <strong>+ Join Now</strong>, and you will automatically become a member.  If the Project is private, click <strong>+ Request Membership</strong> and the Project administrator will be notified of your request.  Once she approves the request you’ll be added as a member.

3. A Project administrator may invite you to join a Project. In this case, check your email inbox for a notification that you have been invited to join the Project.  Click the view invites link in that email.   You will then be prompted to log in.  When you do so, you’ll be on your “Invitations” page.  Click <strong>Accept</strong> next to the invitation for the project.
