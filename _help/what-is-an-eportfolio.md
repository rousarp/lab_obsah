Each ePortfolio consists of both a Site and an associated Profile that are linked to an OpenLab member’s personal Profile, and can be created by anyone in the OpenLab community.

ePortfolios are a digital representation of students’ academic work, interests, and achievements that any City Tech student can create.  The student ePortfolio site is set up to include pages that students in any major or profession can use, but you may customize the site in any way that suits you.  Students might show their ePortfolio to potential employers or graduate schools, or share it with friends and family.  Each student on the OpenLab can create a single ePortfolio, then develop and add to it throughout their career at City Tech.  By their final semester, students will have a comprehensive career ePortfolio including their professional goals statement and resume, and highlighting their best academic work.

Similar to Courses, Projects, and Clubs, each ePortfolio has a Profile page so that visitors can easily find it by searching or browsing in the ePortfolios section of the OpenLab.

From your ePortfolio Profile, visitors can easily access your ePortfolio Site.

And, you can access both your ePortfolio Profile and Site from My OpenLab.

<strong>What is the difference between an ePortfolio and a Project?</strong>

ePortfolios are intended for a specific use–to showcase students’ academic and professional work.  <a title="What is a Project on the OpenLab?" href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/what-is-a-project-on-the-openlab/">Projects</a>, on the other hand, are multi-purpose, and may encompass a wide range of uses.  Projects can also be created by individuals (not just students) or groups.  ePortfolios are only created by individuals, and are linked to one specific Profile.
