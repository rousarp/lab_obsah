1. To create a page on your site, go to your site Dashboard and click <strong>Pages &gt; Add New</strong> in the left-hand menu.

2. On the following screen, you will see a title line, a text box, and a formatting toolbar.  Here you can enter a title for your page and the content that you would like to appear on your page.  To modify your text (e.g., to change the font style, add a link, etc.), highlight the text that you want to change and click the appropriate button from the formatting toolbar.  You can also add <a title="Adding images to your Site" href="https://lab.urad.online/blog/help/adding-images-to-your-site/">images</a>, audio, or <a title="Adding video to your Site" href="https://lab.urad.online/blog/help/adding-video-to-your-site/">video</a> to your page by clicking the icon next to <strong>Upload/Insert</strong>.

3. Once you have finished adding content to your page, click <strong>Publish</strong> in the “Publish” section of the right-hand menu.  If you would like to see how your page will look before you publish it, click <strong>Preview</strong> in the right-hand menu.  Additionally, if you would like to continue working on your page and publish it at a later time, click <strong>Save Draft</strong> in the right-hand menu.

4. You can also change or edit your page’s privacy settings by clicking <strong>Edit</strong> in the Visibility settings in the same right-hand menu.  You can choose to make your page public, password protected, or private.

5. Lastly, in the “Page Attributes” section of the right-hand menu, you can edit your page attributes.  In this menu, you can give your page a parent (i.e., make the page appear as a sub-page on another page on your site) and/or edit the template options of your page.  For more information about page attributes, click the <strong>Help &gt; Page Attributes</strong> in the top right-hand corner of your screen.  Note: Make sure that you are still on the screen where your page text box appears.
