Go to the <strong>Profile Page</strong> of the Course, Project, or Club you administer, and click <strong>Membership</strong> in the right hand menu.  You’ll find two main areas. The major portion of the page (where all the avatars are), and the submenu just above them where you can accept Member Requests, Invite New Members, Email Members, or change Your Email Options. We’ll deal with each of these in turn.

<h3><strong>Main Area</strong></h3>
1. Here you will see all the members of your site, arranged by current role. Find the member you would like to change, then change their role in the <strong>Change Role</strong> drop down menu to the right of their avatar. The roles include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Kick and ban</strong> – Removes the user from the course, project, or club until the admin unbans that user</li>
 	<li><strong>Promote to mod</strong> – Allows the user to serve as a moderator in the course, project, or club. A moderator can edit course, project, or club details; edit, close, and delete forum topics; and edit and delete docs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Promote to admin</strong> – Allows the user to serve as an admin. Admins can do anything a moderator can do, plus change course, project, or club settings (such as changing privacy settings and turning on and off plug-ins). They can also change the avatar, manage membership, and delete the course, project, or club.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remove from course, project, or club</strong> – Removes the user, but does not ban them. The user can rejoin or request membership without admin action.</li>
</ul>
2. Use can change the email settings for any member of the course, project, or club.

NOTE: All changes made here will affect your site as well. That is, a user promoted to administrator will be able to make changes here on the profile page, and will be able to make changes on the course, project, or club site.
<h3><strong>Accepting Member Requests</strong></h3>
1. To accept (or reject) Member Requests, simply click <strong>Member Requests</strong>, then click <strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Reject</strong> next to the requesting member’s avatar.

<h3><strong>Inviting New Members</strong></h3>
1. To invite new members, click <strong>Invite New Members</strong>. From there you’ll see two options for inviting OpenLab members to join your course, project or club: you can type their name directly into the search bar, or you can look for them in the drop down menu.

2. Once you’ve found them, click <strong>Send Invite</strong>.

<h3><strong>Emailing Members</strong></h3>
1. To email members, click <strong>Email Members</strong>. From there you’ll be taken to the page below, where you can fill out the subject, type the email, and then click <strong>Email this notice to everyone in the group</strong>. As you can see, this is only if you want to send an email to every member of the group. To email members individually, you’ll want to visit their profile.
