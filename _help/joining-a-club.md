2. If the Club is public, click <strong>+ Join Now</strong>, and you will automatically become a member.  If the Club is private, click <strong>+ Request Membership</strong> and the Club administrator will be notified of your request.  Once she approves the request you’ll be added as a member.

3. A Club administrator may invite you to join a Club. In this case, check your email inbox for a notification that you have been invited to join the Club.  Click the view invites link in that email.   You will then be prompted to log in.  When you do so, you’ll be on your “Invitations” page.  Click <strong>Accept</strong> next to the invitation for the Club.
