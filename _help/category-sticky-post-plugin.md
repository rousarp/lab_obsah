<a title="Category Sticky Post" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/category-sticky-post/">Category Sticky Post for WordPress</a> is a plugin that allows you to mark a post as sticky within a specific category archive. It works exactly like the typical sticky post functionality within WordPress, except that it’s specifically for category archives.

To use it, first activate the plug-in. Once you do, you’ll see a new “Category Sticky” field appear above “Categories.”

If you choose a category from the drop-down, the post that you’re currently editing or creating will automatically “stick” to the top of the category archive. This is particularly useful if you’re using a custom menu with category archives–it will allow you to post an introduction, say, or some other bit of contextual information for the archive.

That’s it! As always, <a href="http://openlab@citytech.cuny.edu">let us know</a> if you have any questions.
