1. When you type in the URL, or web address for your site, you are viewing the public side or “front-end” of your site.  If you have kept your site public, anyone can see this.

<a href="https://lab.urad.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Site_Dashboard1n.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5608" title="Site_Dashboard1n" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Site_Dashboard1n.png" alt="site front end screenshot" /></a>

2. The private section of your site is called the “Dashboard.”  It is the “back-end,” or administrative area.  This section of your site is only available only to you (i.e., the site Administrator) and to <a title="Managing users on your Site" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/managing-users-on-your-site/">those who you choose to share your site with</a>.

3. You can access your site Dashboard from the <a title="What is a Course on the OpenLab?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/what-is-a-course-on-the-openlab/">course</a>, <a title="What is a Project on the OpenLab?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/what-is-a-project-on-the-openlab/">project</a>, or <a title="What is a Club on the OpenLab?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/what-is-a-club-on-the-openlab/">club</a> profile page on which you have added a site.  Login to the OpenLab, and click <strong>My OpenLab</strong> in the main menu.  In the right-hand menu on the following screen, click the category for which you have created a site (i.e., <strong>My Course</strong>, <strong>My Project</strong>, <strong>My Club</strong>). Click the appropriate course, project, or club title to access its respective Profile page.

<a href="https://lab.urad.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_the_site_dashboard1v2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-36860 size-full" title="Site_Dashboard2n" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_the_site_dashboard1v2.png" alt="my openlab screenshot" /></a>

4. From the Course, Project or Club Profile page, click <strong>Dashboard</strong> in the right-hand menu.

<a href="https://lab.urad.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_the_site_dashboard2v2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-36862 size-full" title="Site_Dashboard3" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_the_site_dashboard2v2.png" alt="site dashboard link screenshot" /></a>

5. You can also access your site Dashboard from the front-end of your site by going to the “Home” page of your site and clicking <strong>Site Admin</strong> under <strong>Meta</strong> in the right-hand menu.  On most sites (depending on the theme you’ve chosen) you can also access the Dashboard by clicking <strong>Edit</strong> next to a post.

<a href="https://lab.urad.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Site_Dashboard4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3088" title="Site_Dashboard4" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Site_Dashboard4.png" alt="site admin link screenshot" /></a>

6. When you open the Dashboard screen, you should see a menu on the left-hand side of your screen.  This is where you can create, manage, and edit the content of your site, as well as create, manage, and edit the functions on your site.  Depending on your role, you will see different options in this menu. <strong> <em>Only</em> an administrator will see all of them.</strong>
