1. If you are faculty, you can create a site on the OpenLab as an extension of your <a title="What is a course on the OpenLab?" href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/what-is-a-course-on-the-openlab/">course</a>, <a title="What is a Project on the OpenLab?" href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/what-is-a-project-on-the-openlab/">project</a>, or <a title="What is a Club on the OpenLab?" href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/what-is-a-club-on-the-openlab/">club</a>.  Your site provides an additional online presence for your course, project, or club where you can create content (e.g., blog posts), maintain content (e.g., a syllabus or project description), and engage in discussion with other site <a title="Managing users on your Site" href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/managing-users-on-your-site/">users</a>.

2. If you are a student, you can create a site on the OpenLab as an extension of your project or club.  The site that you create for a project or club is an extension of that project or club, and provides an additional online presence for it.  You can create content (e.g., blog posts), maintain content (e.g., a project description or club mission statement), and engage in discussion with other site users &lt;links to “Managing Users on My Site”&gt;.

3. To create a site for a course (faculty-only), project, or club, log in to the OpenLab and click <strong>My OpenLab</strong> in the main menu.  On the following screen, click the appropriate category for which you would like to create a site (i.e., <strong>My Courses</strong>, <strong>My Projects</strong>, <strong>My Clubs</strong>).

4. Click <strong>+ Create a Course</strong> (faculty-only), <strong>+ Create a Project</strong>, or <strong>+ Create a Club</strong>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-36851 size-full" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site2v2.png" sizes="(max-width: 1175px) 100vw, 1175px" srcset="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site2v2.png 1175w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site2v2-300x159.png 300w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site2v2-1024x542.png 1024w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site2v2-32x17.png 32w" alt="My OpenLab Create Screenshot" />

5. After you have filled in the requisite information, you will be given the option of creating a new site, using an existing site, or using an external site.  To create a new site, check the box next to “Create a Site?” at the bottom of your screen.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-36852 size-full" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site3v2.png" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" srcset="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site3v2.png 883w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site3v2-300x178.png 300w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/what_is_a_site3v2-32x19.png 32w" alt="Create a Site Screenshot" />

6. Enter a title (also the URL) for your new site.  You can also, if you choose, link the Course, Project or Club to an already existing external (non-OpenLab) site.  Then click <strong>Create Course and Continue</strong> (faculty-only), <strong>Create Project and Continue</strong>, or <strong>Create Club and Continue</strong>.

7. Note: If you do not wish to create your own site, you also have the option of joining a site created by someone else.  If you are a student, you can also join a site that has been created for a course in which you are enrolled.  You can also change or add a site to your course (faculty-only), project, or club at a later time by going to your Course, Project or Club’s Profile page, and clicking <strong>Settings</strong> in the right hand menu.
