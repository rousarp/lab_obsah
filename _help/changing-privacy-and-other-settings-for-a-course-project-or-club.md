<h3><strong>Privacy Settings</strong></h3>
1. <strong>Profile privacy settings</strong> allow you to change how OpenLab members can join your Course, Project or Club, and whether non-members can see Discussion, Docs, and Files content on the Profile.  <strong>Site privacy settings</strong> are separate and can be changed just beneath Profile privacy settings.  These settings determine who can see the Course, Project, or Club Site.
<h4><strong>Profile privacy settings</strong></h4>
<strong>This is a public course, project, or club:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The course, project, or club profile and related content and activity will be visible to anyone, whether or not they are members of the OpenLab.</li>
 	<li>The course, project, or club profile will be listed in OpenLab directories and search results.</li>
 	<li>Any OpenLab member may join this course, project, or club.</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is a private course, project, or club:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The course, project, or club profile and related content and activity will only be visible to members.</li>
 	<li>The course, project, or club profile will be listed in OpenLab directories and search results.</li>
 	<li>Only OpenLab members who request membership and are accepted by an <a title="Who Can Change Settings for Courses, Projects, and Clubs?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/who-can-change-settings-for-courses-projects-and-clubs-2/">administrator</a> may join this course.</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is a hidden course, project, or club:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The course, project, or club profile, related content, and activity will only be visible only to members.</li>
 	<li>The course, project, or club profile will NOT be listed in the OpenLab directories and search results.</li>
 	<li>Only OpenLab members who are invited may join this course, project, or club.</li>
</ul>
2. Once you’ve selected the best option for you, click <strong>Save Changes</strong> at the bottom of the page.

<h4><strong>Site Privacy Settings</strong></h4>
3. Site privacy settings are just beneath Profile privacy settings.

<strong>Public</strong>

<strong>Allow search engines to index this site:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Anyone can visit your site without needing a password.</li>
 	<li>Search engines will index all pages and posts, meaning your site will show up in search results on Google, Bing, and others.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option for maximum public visibility.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ask search engines not to index this site:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Visitors do not need a password to see your site if they know the URL or are linked from elsewhere, but Google, Bing and other search engines should not index your posts and pages. (Please note: it is up to search engines to honor your request.)</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you want to be able to show the site to people who are not members of the OpenLab, but you don’t want people to stumble upon it via search engines.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Private</strong>

<strong>I would like my site to be visible only to registered users of City Tech OpenLab:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Anyone who is signed into the OpenLab can see this site.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you’d only like the OpenLab community to be able to see the site.</li>
</ul>
<strong>I would like my site to be visible to registered users I add:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Choose this option if you only want members of your course, project, or club to be able to see the site.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hidden</strong>

<strong>I would like my site to be visible only to me:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>No one except site admins can see the site.</li>
 	<li>You may choose this option if you are in the process of creating your course site, but it would rarely be useful for an active course, project, or club.</li>
</ul>
4. Once you’ve selected the best option for you, click <strong>Save Changes</strong> at the bottom of the page.

<h3><strong>Email Subscription Defaults</strong></h3>
1. These settings control the default email settings for new members of your course, project, or club.  Individual members may <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/changing-your-email-options-for-a-course-project-or-club/">change their own settings</a> at any time, but these settings set the automatic standard for anyone who signs up.

<strong>No Email</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Members will not receive emails when there’s activity in Discussion, Docs, or Files.</li>
 	<li>This is good for large courses, projects, or clubs where there’s a lot of activity and daily emails might be too much.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Weekly Summary Email</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Members will receive a weekly summary of all activity.</li>
 	<li>This is good for large courses, projects, or clubs where there’s a lot of activity and daily emails might be too much, but you want members to receive some notification.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Daily Digest Email</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Members receive an email once per day that summarizes all activity for that day.</li>
 	<li>This is good for medium size courses, projects, or clubs.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Topics Email</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Members receive emails every time a new topic begins, but will not receive emails notifying them of replies to that topic.</li>
 	<li>This might be good for small courses, projects, or clubs, but will still generate a lot of email for larger groups.</li>
</ul>
<strong>All Email</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Members receive an email any time there is activity in the course, project, or club.</li>
 	<li>This is recommended for smaller courses, projects, or clubs where the emails won’t be overwhelming, or where it’s important that members are notified of all activity as it happens.</li>
</ul>
2. Once you’ve selected the best option for you, click <strong>Save Changes</strong> at the bottom of the page.

<h3><strong>Post or Page Privacy Settings</strong></h3>
Privacy settings for individual posts and pages need to be changed on your <a title="What is the Site Dashboard?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/what-is-the-site-dashboard/">Site Dashboard</a>.

1. On the right side of the post or page editor screen, there is a box with <strong>Publish</strong> options.

2. Next to Visibility: Public click <strong>Edit</strong>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-36755 size-full" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Changing_Settings_8_v3.png" alt="Changing Privacy Settings Screen Shot" />

In the expanded view, you have three options:

<strong>A. Public</strong>
This is the standard setting and makes the post or page visible to anyone who can visit the site. Under Public, you can also opt to<strong> Stick this post to the front page</strong>. This keeps the site post at the top of the site’s home page, even as newer items are posted.

<strong> B. Password Protected</strong>
Choose this option if you want to control who can view the post or page and who cannot. Once you click the button it will ask you to create a password specific to that post or page.  Only people who enter the password can view the post or page.

<strong>C. Private</strong>
This makes it so the post or page is only visible to the its author and <a title="Managing users on your Site" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/managing-users-on-your-site/">site administrators</a>. This option may be useful in a course site if you are having students post assignments to the site and you do not want them to be visible to the entire class.

3. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save when you are done and then <strong>Publish</strong> when you are ready, or <strong>Update</strong> if the post is already published.

Please note: Students should check with their professors before making a post password protected or private.
