PLEASE NOTE: Each site has a size limit and unnecessarily large images can take up more of your space than you’d like. If you are sharing many large images, we suggest hosting them with an external storage solution, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Flickr, among others. Instructions for embedding externally hosted images is <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/adding-images-to-your-site/#embedding">below</a>.  You can also read our guide to <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/sharing-large-files-on-the-openlab">sharing large files on the OpenLab</a>.  If you’re uploading images it’s important to optimize them as much as possible before you upload; you can learn more about resizing images <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/openroad/2012/04/23/image-resizing-part-2/">here</a>.
<h3>Uploading images and other media</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>To upload images or other media (e.g. pdfs, Word docs, txt files) to a post or a page, go to your <strong>Dashboard</strong> &gt; <strong>Posts</strong> &gt; <strong>Add New</strong> or <strong>Pages</strong> &gt; <strong>Add New</strong>.  On the “Add New Post” or “Add New Page” screen, click <strong>Add Media</strong> from above the text box toolbar.</li>
 	<li>You can select files saved to your computer or flash drive by clicking <strong>Upload Files</strong>. Then, either drag-and-drop files from saved to your computer or click <strong>Select Files</strong>.  You can also select image or other files from your media library by clicking the <strong>Media Library</strong> tab.</li>
 	<li>On the following screen, you can make adjustments to the file you want to upload using the options on the right-hand side of the screen.  You can re-title the image (to make it easier to manage or find later), add a caption to appear underneath the image, and change the “Alignment” and “Size” of the image.</li>
 	<li>After you are finished making adjustments, click <strong>Insert into Post</strong>, in the bottom right-hand corner of the page.</li>
</ol>
5, The image will appear in your post.  When you’re finished with the post, click <strong>Publish</strong>.
<ol start="6">
 	<li>You can also add images to your media library to use later in posts and pages.  Go to your site <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/what-is-the-site-dashboard/">Dashboard</a> and click <strong>Media &gt; Add New</strong> in the left-hand menu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Embedding externally-hosted images</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>You can also embed images hosted elsewhere (from another site, such as WikiMedia or from your own external storage service, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Flickr, among others). On the “Add New Post” or “Add New Page” screen, click <strong>Add Media</strong> from above the text box toolbar.</li>
 	<li>Click <strong>Insert from URL</strong> in the top left corner and paste the URL of the image.  You can make adjustments such as adding a caption or changing the alignment.</li>
 	<li>Click <strong>Insert into Post</strong>, in the bottom right corner of the page.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Embedding images from Flickr</h3>
For most sites, such as Google Drive, Google Plus, or Dropbox, it’s easy to find an image’s URL. It’s a little trickier on Flickr, so we’ve included instructions below.
<ol>
 	<li>To get an image URL, you need to <strong>View all sizes</strong> of the image. Right click on the image itself, or click on the icon to view more options (three dots, at the far right-hand side). Choose <strong>View all sizes</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Choose the size you want, and right click on the image. Choose <strong>Copy Image Location</strong> (the wording may vary depending on your browser — you just want to copy the image link or URL).</li>
 	<li>Paste the URL into the “Insert from URL” page, described in step 1 above for embedding externally-hosted images and follow the rest of those directions.</li>
</ol>
