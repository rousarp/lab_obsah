You can changes settings for your ePortfolio on the ePortfolio Profile page.  These might include privacy settings, changing an avatar, or changing the description or title of your ePortfolio.
<ol>
 	<li>Log in and click <strong>My OpenLab</strong> in the main menu.  In the right-hand menu, click the <strong>Profile</strong> link, which appears under <strong>Portfolio Site</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You will now be on at your <strong>ePortfolio Profile</strong>. In the right-hand menu, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
 	<li>At the top of the page, you will see the portfolio settings menu.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Edit Profile</strong></h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Here you can change your ePortfolio name and description.  After you enter your changes, be sure to click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You can also choose to change the site associated with your ePortfolio. Click <strong>Unlink</strong> next to “This ePortfolio is currently associated with the site My ePortfolio.”  You will be able to choose to link to an existing site or an external site (not hosted on the OpenLab).  You could also choose to create a new ePortfolio site.  When you’re finished, click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Change Avatar</strong></h3>
<ol>
 	<li>If you have an image file ready that you would like to use as your avatar, click <strong>Choose File</strong>.  Select the file you want to use from your computer or flash drive and then click <strong>Upload Image</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Crop the image by dragging the square around the portion of the image you want to use and click <strong>Crop Image</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You can also delete your current avatar if you wish (see image above), but we recommend you upload a new one.  If you delete your avatar, the system will automatically assign you a generic avatar.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Privacy Settings</strong></h3>
Profile privacy settings allow you to change the settings that control whether or not your ePortfolio profile and related content and activity will be visible to the public, show up in the Portfolio directory, and/or appear in search results.
<ol>
 	<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy Settings</strong>.</li>
 	<li>First, choose your <strong>Profile</strong> privacy settings.  These settings control the privacy of the ePortfolio profile, and are different from the ePortfolio <strong>Site</strong>, which you will choose next.</li>
</ol>
<strong>This is a public ePortfolio:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This ePortfolio Profile and related content and activity will be visible to anyone, whether or not they are members of the OpenLab.</li>
 	<li>This ePortfolio Profile will be listed in the Portfolios directory, search results, or OpenLab home page.</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is a private Portfolio:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This ePortfolio Profile, related content, and activity will only be visible only to members of your ePortfolio.</li>
 	<li>This ePortfolio profile will NOT be listed in the Portfolios directory, search results, or OpenLab home page.</li>
 	<li>The link to this Portfolio Profile and Site will not be publicly visible on your OpenLab Profile.</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is a hidden ePortfolio:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This ePortfolio Profile, related content, and activity will only be visible only to members of your ePortfolio.</li>
 	<li>This ePortfolio profile will NOT be listed in the Portfolios directory, search results, or  the OpenLab home page.</li>
 	<li>The link to this Portfolio Profile and Site will not be publicly visible on your OpenLab Profile.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Next, choose the privacy settings for your ePortfolio <strong>Site</strong>.  These settings control whether others can view your site.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Public</strong>

<strong>Allow search engines to index this site:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Anyone can visit your site without needing a password.</li>
 	<li>Search engines will index all pages and posts, meaning your site will show up in search results on Google, Bing, and others.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option for maximum public visibility.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ask search engines not to index this site:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Visitors do not need a password to see your site if they know the URL or are linked from elsewhere, but Google, Bing and other search engines should not index your posts and pages. (Please note: it is up to search engines to honor your request.)</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you want to be able to show the site to people who are not members of the OpenLab, but you don’t want people to stumble upon it via search engines.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Private</strong>

I would like my site to be visible only to registered users of City Tech OpenLab:
<ul>
 	<li>Anyone who is signed into the OpenLab can see this site.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you’d only like the OpenLab community to be able to see the site.</li>
</ul>
<strong>I would like my site to be visible to registered users I add:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Choose this option if you only want members of your ePortfolio to be able to see the site.</li>
</ul>
<strong>I would like my site to be visible only to me:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>No one except site admins can see the site.</li>
 	<li>You may choose this option if you are in the process of creating your ePortfolio, but it would rarely be useful for an active ePortfolio.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>When you are finished, click <strong>Save Changes</strong> at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Allowing Others to View a Private ePortfolio</strong></h3>
Any other members of the OpenLab–for example, your professors, classmates, and advisor–can be added as members of your ePortfolio so they can view your work even if it’s private.
<h4>Requesting Membership</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>The easiest way for someone to view your ePortfolio is for them to request membership themselves. To go so, they should go to your ePortfolio Profile and click <strong>Request Membership</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Once they request membership, you will receive an email notification that they have done so.  Either click on the link in the email or go to your <strong>ePortfolio Profile</strong> &gt; <strong>Membership</strong> &gt; <strong>Member Requests</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You will see them listed on the page.  Click <strong>Accept</strong>, and they will be added as a member.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Inviting Members to Join</h4>
You can also invite members to join your ePortfolio.
<ol>
 	<li>Go to <strong>Membership</strong> &gt; <strong>Invite New Members</strong>. Start typing their name, and when you see it appear, click on their name to add them to the invite list.</li>
 	<li>When you are finished adding the person or people you want to invite to the list, click the <strong>Send Invites</strong> button and they’ll receive their invitation.</li>
 	<li>To remove someone, go to Membership and next to their name, click <strong>Remove from Group</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Delete an ePortfolio</strong></h3>
Once you delete your ePortfolio, you can not get it back; you would need to create a new one.

If you are sure you want to delete it, check the box indicating that you understand the consequences of deleting this portfolio. Click <strong>Delete ePortfolio</strong>.

Please note: the site associated with the ePortfolio you delete will still remain.  If you would like to delete the site as well, you will need to go to the Dashboard of that site to delete the site separately.
