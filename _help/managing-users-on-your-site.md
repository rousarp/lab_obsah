The <a title="Who can build a Site?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/who-can-build-a-site/">site administrator</a> has sole access to the full site <a title="What is the Site Dashboard?" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/what-is-the-site-dashboard/">Dashboard</a>.  If you would like others to be able to post, edit, and/or manage posts, they will need to become members of your <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/help-category/courses-projects-clubs/">course, project, or club</a>.  All members of a course, project, or club will have the ability to post on the site as authors.  This means they can publish and edit their own content, but cannot change or delete anything that anyone else has created on the site.

To add users to your site, they will need to join (for public courses, projects or clubs), request membership (for private course, projects and clubs), or be invited via the profile page for the course, project, or club for which the site was created.  (See instructions for <a title="Joining a course" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/joining-a-course/">joining or requesting membership for courses</a>)

1. To invite members, you can access your course, project, or club profile page by logging in to the OpenLab, and clicking <strong>My OpenLab</strong> in the main menu, and then clicking the appropriate category (i.e., <strong>My Courses, My Projects, My Clubs</strong>) in the right-hand menu.

2.  Once you are on the correct page, select the specific course (faculty-only), project, or club for which you have created a site.  This will take you to your course, project, or club profile page.  On this page, you can invite individuals to become users of your site by clicking <strong>Membership</strong> in the right-hand menu, and then clicking <strong>Invite New Members</strong> on the following screen.  The prospective user will receive an automated confirmation e-mail.  Once the e-mail address is confirmed by the user, they will be added to your site as an “Author” (see definition below).  This is the default user role for every newly added course, project or club member.

3. All current members will appear at the bottom of your course, project, or club’s profile page, listed as “Members.”

<p dir="ltr">4. You can assign the user roles listed below to any user on your site.  However, you cannot change user roles from your site Dashboard, you must go to the course, project, or club profile.  Click on <strong>Membership</strong> in the right-hand menu.  On the Membership page, find the user(s) whose role you want to change.  To make members (who are Authors on your site) into Admins, click <strong>Promote to Admin</strong>, and for Admins, you can click <strong>Demote to member</strong> to make them Authors on the site. Please note, this will also change their role in the course, project, or club profile functions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">➝ <strong>Administrator</strong>: When you create a site, you are the site “Administrator.”  You can control every aspect of your site, from managing content and comments, to choosing site themes to activating widgets and plugins.  In most cases, you should not make another site user an Administrator unless you want them to have equal control over your site content and functions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">➝ <strong>Author</strong>: Authors can publish and edit their own content, but cannot change or delete anything that anyone else has created on the site.  In most cases, if you are adding additional users to your site, making them site Authors is the best choice.</p>
