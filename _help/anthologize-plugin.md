To quote <a title="View all posts by Ryan Cordell" href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/author/rcordell">Ryan Cordell</a>‘s article on the plug-in: “Anthologize was developed as a way for scholars to easily publish blog content—from a personal research blog, a course blog, or scholarly group blog, or the like—in a number of formats”:

Anthologize is a free, open-source, plugin that transforms WordPress 3.0 into a platform for publishing electronic texts. Grab posts from your WordPress blog, import feeds from external sites, or create new content directly within Anthologize. Then outline, order, and edit your work, crafting it into a single volume for export in several formats, including—in this release—PDF, ePUB, TEI.

Using Anthologize is very simple, and we really cannot improve on the developers own guide, which you can find <a href="http://anthologize.org/learn/user-guide/">here</a>.  We’ve copied the main page below for ease of use.  As always, <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/support/contact-us">contact us</a> with any questions!
