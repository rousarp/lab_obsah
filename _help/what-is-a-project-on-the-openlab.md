Students, faculty, and staff can develop projects individually or together to represent a range of activities at City Tech. A project can be academic or social in nature. For example, students collaborating on a class assignment may choose to create a project where they work together on documents and have discussions, eventually building a full Site to display their work.  Other members of the City Tech community might create a project to demonstrate research completed as part of a grant project, and faculty might create a project for a learning community.  Each project offers a <a title="Using “Discussion” forums" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/discussion-forums/">Discussion</a> forum, <a title="Using “Docs”" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/using-docs/">Docs</a> for collaborative editing, a place to upload <a title="Using “Files”" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/using-files/">Files</a>, and a <a title="What is a “Site” on a Course, Project, or Club?" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/what-is-a-site-on-a-course-project-or-club/">Site</a> where members can write posts (blog entries), provide feedback, and share files and other resources.
<h3><strong>Project Profile</strong></h3>
Every project has a Profile and a Site.  The Profile is like a portal for the project, displaying an avatar (profile picture), project description, list of members, and access to <a title="Using “Discussion” forums" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/discussion-forums/">Discussion</a>, <a title="Using “Docs”" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/using-docs/">Docs</a>, <a title="Using “Files”" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/using-files/">Files</a>, and the Project <a title="What is a “Site” on a Course, Project, or Club?" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/what-is-a-site-on-a-course-project-or-club/">Site</a>, and for administrators, access to <a title="Changing privacy and other settings for a Course, Project, or Club" href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/changing-privacy-and-other-settings-for-a-course-project-or-club/">admin settings</a>.

If a project is private, non-members will only see the avatar and description, as well as a link to the Project Site, which can be either private or public.  OpenLab members who are signed in can request membership, but cannot join without approval of an administrator.

<h3><strong>Project Site</strong></h3>
Project Sites, built with the open source blogging platform <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>, provide a robust space for conversation, collaboration, and sharing.  Project members can write posts, participate in discussions, and share documents.  Different types of files can be posted on a site, including Word docs, PDFs, images, video, and audio.  If the site is public, it is a great way to communicate a project’s work or findings to the City Tech community and even the broader public.
