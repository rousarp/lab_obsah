There are many resources available for students working with ePortfolios.
<h3>ePortfolio Lab, G-606</h3>
There are ongoing workshops as well as individual help available in the <strong>ePortfolio Computer Lab</strong>, in <strong>Room G-606</strong>.

The ePortfolio computer lab located in G-606 is exclusively for students participating in the ePortfolio project, however ePortfolio students may continue to use the lab throughout their academic career at City Tech regardless of whether or not they are taking an ePortfolio course. Students may also use the lab for any computer work, not just ePortfolios. The lab is fully equipped with both hardware and software that support the project, and peer tutors are available at all times to assist students with their ePortfolios. ePortfolio workshops, both reserved for participating classes and open (walk-in), are held in the G606 ePortfolio computer lab.  The hours are:
