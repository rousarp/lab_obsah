Cloning a course will create an exact copy of an existing course, keeping all content you created or uploaded, but student work will not be copied over.  The course avatar, course settings, and site settings will all remain the same, although you can change anything as necessary.
<ol>
 	<li>After logging in, click <strong>My OpenLab</strong> in the main menu. Then click <strong>My Courses</strong> in the right-hand menu. On the My Courses page, click <strong>+ Create / Clone a Course</strong> at the top of the page.</li>
</ol>
1a. You may also begin cloning a course by going to the Profile of the course you would like to clone.  Choose <strong>Course Settings</strong> in the right-hand menu and then <strong>+ Clone Course</strong>.
<h3>Step One: Profile</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>On the first Create/Clone a Course screen, choose <strong>Clone an Existing Course</strong> and then in the dropdown menu, select the course you would like to clone.</li>
 	<li>Enter the <strong>Course Name</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You’ll notice that the description is already filled in, and is the same as the course you are cloning. The School, Department, Course Code, and Section Code are also pre-populated.  You can leave these as they appear or edit.</li>
 	<li>Enter the <strong>Semester</strong> and <strong>Year</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Choose the <strong>site details</strong>.  The button for “Name your cloned site” will be pre-selected.  Fill in the URL for the <strong>new site</strong>.  <strong>Please note</strong>: the site address must be different from the old site, which will be displayed below.  You should also only include the last part of the URL (do not include https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>It is a good practice to add Semester and Year to differentiate between your courses from one semester to another: FacultyLastNameCourseCodeSemYear.  For example: smithadv1100sp2012</li>
 	<li>If you teach multiple sections and plan to create additional course sites on the OpenLab, consider adding other identifying information to the URL, such as the section number or days of the week (for example, MW or TuTh).</li>
</ul>
You may also choose to create a new site, use an existing site, or use an external site.
<ol start="6">
 	<li>When you are finished, click <strong>Create Course and Continue</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 2: Privacy Settings</h3>
The privacy settings for the new course will be the same as the settings for the course you are cloning, but you may change them if you wish.
<ol>
 	<li>Choose your <strong>Profile privacy settings</strong>.  These settings control the privacy of the course profile, and are different from the course site, which you will choose next. You can change the settings at any time.</li>
</ol>
<strong>This is a public course:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The course profile and related content and activity will be visible to the public, whether or not they are members of the OpenLab.</li>
 	<li>The course profile will be listed in the OpenLab course directory and search results.</li>
 	<li>Any OpenLab member may join this course.</li>
 	<li>Even if you want your course to be private, you might want to choose this option for the first few weeks of the semester because it is easier for students to join.</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is a private course:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The course profile and related content and activity will only be visible to members of the course.</li>
 	<li>The course profile will be listed in the course directory and search results.</li>
 	<li>Only OpenLab members who request membership and are accepted by the professor may join this course.</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is a hidden course:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The course profile, related content, and activity will only be visible only to members of the course.</li>
 	<li>The course profile will NOT be listed in the course directory and search results.</li>
 	<li>Only OpenLab members who are invited may join this course.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Next, choose the privacy settings for your course site.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Public:</strong>

<strong>Allow search engines to index this site:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Anyone can visit your site without needing a password.</li>
 	<li>Search engines will index all pages and posts, meaning your site will show up in search results on Google, Bing and others.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option for maximum public visibility.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ask search engines not to index this site:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Visitors do not need a password to see your site if they know the URL or are linked from elsewhere, but Google, Bing and other search engines should not index your posts and pages. (Please note: it is up to search engines to honor your request.)</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you want to be able to show the blog to people who are not members of the OpenLab, but you don’t want people to stumble upon it via search engines.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Private:</strong>

<strong>I would like my site to be visible only to registered users of City Tech OpenLab:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Anyone who is signed into the OpenLab can see this site.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you’d only like the OpenLab community to be able to see the site.</li>
</ul>
<strong>I would like my site to be visible to registered users of this Course:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Only members of your course will be able to visit the site.</li>
 	<li>Choose this option if you only want enrolled students to be able to see the site.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hidden:</strong>

<strong>I would like my site to be visible only to site administrators:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>No one except site admins (only the professor, unless you add others) can see the site.</li>
 	<li>You may choose this option if you are in the process of creating your course site, but it would rarely be useful during an active course.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>When you’re done, click <strong>Next Step</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 3: Course Avatar</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>The avatar for the course you have cloned will appear.  If you would like to keep that avatar, just click <strong>Next Step</strong>. If you would like to change it, click <strong>Browse</strong>.  Select the file you want to use from your computer or flash drive and then click <strong>Upload Image</strong>.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>When you are done click <strong>Next Step.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Step Four: Inviting Members</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>If you would like to invite members to your Course, start typing their display name.  When a dropdown list appears, select their name from the list.  Their name and avatar will appear under the heading Invites.  When you’re finished, or if you do not wish to invite anyone at this time (you can always do it later!), click <strong>Finish</strong>, at the bottom of the page.</li>
 	<li>After you click <strong>Finish</strong> your course will be cloned, and you will be on the <strong>Course Profile</strong> page of your new course!  From here, you can (a) change settings such as privacy, Course description, or (b) change your avatar.  From your Course Profile you can also access your (c) Course Site and <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/what-is-the-site-dashboard/">Dashboard</a> (the admin panel, where you will edit and add content to your Course Site).</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please note:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>All your <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/writing-a-post/">posts</a> and <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/creating-pages-on-your-site/">pages</a> from the previous course site will also have been cloned.  However, they will be in draft form, so you will need to publish any that you would like to appear on the new site. If you do not publish them, it will appear that your site is empty.</li>
 	<li>If you had a custom <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/changing-the-menu-on-your-site/">menu</a> it will need to be activated before it appears on the new site.  To do so, go to Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus and click on the Manage Locations tab at the top of the Edit Menus page.  Choose your menu from the Primary Navigation dropdown and click Save Changes.</li>
 	<li>You will notice that any posts on the <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/discussion-forums/">Discussion forum</a> or <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/using-docs/">Docs</a> you created or <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/using-files/">Files</a> you uploaded in the previous course will appear in the new course. You can keep or delete any as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>The <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/changing-the-appearance-of-your-site-with-themes/">theme</a> and header image will remain the same, although you may change these at any time.  In addition, any <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/adding-plugins-to-your-site/">plugins</a> or widgets you had activated on your old site will appear on the new site.</li>
</ul>
