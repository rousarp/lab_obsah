You can find instructions and look up your City Tech email username <a href="http://cis.citytech.cuny.edu/Student/it_student_findemail.aspx">here</a>.  Instructions are also included below.  Please note: Alumni have access to City Tech email for life.  According to the <a href="http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/alumni/faqs.aspx">City Tech Alumni FAQ</a>, “You’ll be able to continue to send and receive e-mails after graduating. Just make sure to log in at least once a year or it will go dormant, in which case you will have to log in and follow a few steps to reactivate it.”

1. Go to the <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=2&amp;ct=1377636614&amp;rver=6.1.6206.0&amp;wp=MBI_KEY&amp;wreply=https:%2F%2Fwww.outlook.com%2Fowa%2F&amp;id=260563&amp;whr=mail.citytech.cuny.edu&amp;CBCXT=out">Microsoft Office 365 email login</a>.

2. Log in using your <strong>City Tech email</strong> and <strong>password</strong>.  If you have previously logged into your account, skip to step #3.  If you have never logged in to your City Tech email before, do not create a new account–log in using the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Username</strong>: firstname.lastname@mail.citytech.cuny.edu</li>
 	<li><strong>Password</strong>: Your date of birth in mmddyy format and the last four digits of your CUNYfirst Empl ID.  This means your password will be a 10 digit number with no spaces.</li>
</ul>
For example, if your name is Lisa Simpson and you were born on December 1, 1994, and the last four digits of your CUNYfirst Empl ID are 1234 you would log in using the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Username: lisa.simpson@mail.citytech.cuny.edu</li>
 	<li>Password: 1201941234</li>
</ul>

If you are logging in for the first time, you will be asked a number of questions, such as your location, time zone, and contact information.  Answer these questions, and if prompted to create a new password, do so, but make sure to write it down!

3. If you have logged in before, log in using your City Tech email (same format as above), and the password you chose.  If you have logged in previously, you have probably changed the password from the default birthdate+Empl ID.

If you can’t remember your password and need to have it reset, please contact the Help Desk on the first floor of the Atrium Building.  They can also be reached at 718-260-4900 or studenthelpdesk@citytech.cuny.edu.

Once you have gone through the OpenLab registration process described here you will receive an email from the OpenLab in your City Tech email inbox.  Click on the link, or copy and paste it into a new browser tab or window to complete your registration.
