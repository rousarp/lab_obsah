<h4>How do I make someone else the admin? I’m the admin for my club but I’m graduating.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>If they’re not already a member of your club on the OpenLab, they’ll need to <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/joining-a-club/">join it</a>.<a name="change2project"></a></li>
 	<li>Once they’ve joined or if they’re already a member, you can promote them to admin status from the <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/managing-membership-of-a-course-project-or-club-2/">“Members” section</a> on the profile page of your club.<a name="multipleadmins"></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>How do I make it possible to allow several people to be able to update our club website?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>All members of the Club can update the site, but you can more closely manage <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/managing-users-on-your-site/">who can do what</a>.<a name="linksite"></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>How do I link our existing website to our OpenLab Club Profile?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>You can do that when you <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/who-can-build-a-site/">create your club</a> on the OpenLab.<a name="newsite"></a></li>
 	<li>If you’ve already created your club, you can add the external site in your club Settings.<a name="linksite"></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>How do I start using a site on the OpenLab if our club has another website already?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>If you have your club’s website already linked to your profile on the OpenLab, you can unlink it in Settings.</li>
 	<li>If you don’t have your club’s website linked to your profile on the OpenLab, you can create a site either when you <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/what-is-a-site-on-a-course-project-or-club/">start your club</a> on the OpenLab or later in your club’s Settings.<a name="post"></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>How do I post or upload material on the OpenLab?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>You can post or upload materials to your club’s profile page or to your club site.</li>
 	<li>For example, on your club’s profile page, you can <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/discussion-forums/">post new topics to a discussion forum</a>.</li>
 	<li>You can also <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/using-files/">upload files to your club’s profile page</a> or create a <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/using-docs/">collaborative document</a>.</li>
 	<li>You can post and/or upload materials to your club site by going to the club profile and clicking <strong>Dashboard</strong> underneath the <strong>Club Site</strong> link on the right-hand side of your screen.</li>
 	<li>From the Dashboard, you can click <strong>Posts</strong> &gt; <strong>Add New</strong> <a href="https://lab.urad.online/help/writing-a-post/">to post or upload your club materials</a> to your site.</li>
