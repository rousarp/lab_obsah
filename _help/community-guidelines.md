Since the OpenLab is just that — open — it’s important for City Tech faculty, students, and staff to contribute to a welcoming and safe environment for all of us to share. We’re all responsible for making the OpenLab a friendly and welcoming place to collaborate.
<h3><b>What can I say?</b></h3>
The OpenLab is a place for you to express yourself–you can say lots of things! Wherever you’re writing on the OpenLab, you’re contributing to a shared community space. Debate is great, though please <b>respect other people’s views and beliefs </b>and consider your impact on others when making your contribution.

Depending on how you are using the OpenLab, some things are more appropriate than others.
<ul>
 	<li><b>If you’re using the Openlab for courses</b>: communicate in a clear and professional manner. Professors and students should have an understanding of expectations for participating on the course site.</li>
 	<li><b>If you’re working with others on a project or club</b>: keep in mind that your collaborators will have expectations, too.</li>
 	<li><b>If you’re using the OpenLab for your own project or ePortfolio</b>: express yourself! Don’t forget, though, that you are representing yourself and your college, perhaps to potential employers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What can I </b><i>not</i><b> say?</b></h3>
Since the OpenLab is an open community space, we cannot tolerate discriminatory posts, or language and/or slander that detracts from our users’ ability to learn, work, and share.
<ul>
 	<li>Do not use racist, sexist, or homophobic, or other bigoted language.</li>
 	<li>Do not use the OpenLab to harass anyone or do anything that is immoral, unethical, or illegal.</li>
</ul>
Due to University regulations, there are also some other restrictions.
<ul>
 	<li>We cannot allow direct commercial activity, like the buying and selling of textbooks, on any of the sites.</li>
 	<li>Because we are a state-funded, public institution, sites cannot endorse or support specific political candidates.</li>
 	<li>Anything you post on the OpenLab should be yours, or properly credited.</li>
</ul>
For more information and an explanation of your responsibility for your own activity on the OpenLab, please consult the <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/about/terms-of-service/">OpenLab Terms of Use</a>.
<h3><b>What should I do if I see something inappropriate?</b></h3>
Members of our community sometimes disagree with one another, but everyone here has a right to expect that they and their work will be treated respectfully, that any criticism will be thoughtful and constructive, and that they will be free from harassment on the site.

If you receive a message or see something that makes you uncomfortable, please let the Community Team know by emailing us at <a href="mailto:OpenLab@citytech.cuny.edu">openlab@citytech.cuny.edu</a>. We will work with everyone involved to come to a resolution. As a last resort, we will intervene to remove content. Repeated posting of inappropriate content may result in loss of access to the OpenLab. Again, please see the <a href="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/about/terms-of-service/">OpenLab Terms of Use</a> for more information.

If you receive a message or see something that suggests someone is an immediate danger to themselves or others, please contact City Tech Public Safety at 718-260-5550.
