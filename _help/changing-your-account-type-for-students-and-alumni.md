If you have a student account, you can change it to alumni once you graduate. Alumni will not lose access to their OpenLab accounts. According to the <a href="http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/alumni/faqs.aspx">City Tech Alumni Association</a>, you may keep your City Tech email address for the rest of your life. However, they note that you should be sure to log in at least once a year so that it does not go dormant, in which case you can reactivate it, but there are a few extra steps involved.

1. To change your account type to alumni, go to <strong>My OpenLab</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>.

2. At the bottom of the page is a dropdown menu for Account Type. Change the setting from student to alumni and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.

3. You may then wish to go to <strong>Edit Profile</strong>, where you can add your <strong>Graduation Year</strong> at the bottom of the page. Click <strong>Save Changes</strong> when you are done.
