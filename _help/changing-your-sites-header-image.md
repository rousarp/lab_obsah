Changing your site’s header image is a quick and easy way to customize your site. A header image refers to the image that appears at the top of every page in many <a title="Changing the appearance of your Site with themes" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/changing-the-appearance-of-your-site-with-themes/">themes</a> (see example below). Depending on your theme, however, the header image will appear differently.  Two themes don’t have header images: “Carrington” doesn’t have a space for image at the top and the “<a title="Sliding Door theme" href="https://lab.urad.online/help/sliding-door-theme/">Sliding Door</a>” header image is actually a visual menu (read more about that here).

1. To change your site’s header, you need to navigate to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> and select <strong>Header</strong> under <strong>Appearance</strong>.  Or, you can choose <strong>Header</strong> from the the dropdown menu at the top from the your site’s main page.

3. To upload an image to use, click <strong>Browse</strong> to find an image from your computer or select <strong>Choose Image</strong> if you already have an image in your media library you want to use.

4. Once you’ve chosen an image, you’ll be given the chance to crop it. Move the cropping window around to choose the section of the image you want to use. Some themes allow you to make the area to be cropped bigger, but remember that means that the image will be bigger on your page. When you’re finished, click <strong>Crop and Publish</strong>.

5. If you upload multiple images, you can choose between these on this same page. In addition you can choose <strong>Random</strong> as an option. This will rotate all of your header images at random so that each time someone visits your site a different image will appear.
