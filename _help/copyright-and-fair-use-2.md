You may be wondering how <a href="http://library.citytech.cuny.edu/research/subjectGuides/wiki/index.php/Copyright_and_Fair_Use">copyright</a> restrictions and <a href="http://library.citytech.cuny.edu/research/subjectGuides/wiki/index.php/Copyright_and_Fair_Use">fair use</a> apply on the OpenLab.

While copyrighted works are restricted by law, there are many uses considered legitimate under the fair use doctrine, which allows the limited usage, within specific parameters, of copyrighted material without receiving permission from the owner. Fair use covers uses such as quotation for the purposes of commentary or criticism, parody, news reporting, and scholarly and educational use.

The same principles you would use in your own scholarly work apply on the OpenLab. However, there are a few differences. Below are some guidelines for teaching on the OpenLab or posting work on your own website. Additional information is available at <a href="http://www.cuny.edu/libraries/services/copyright.html">Copyright @ CUNY</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>While printed coursepacks are considered legal under fair use, it is <b>not </b>legal to post copyrighted materials for download on a website that is open to the public.</li>
 	<li>It is always permissible to link directly to an article available online in one of the City Tech library databases. <a href="http://cityte.ch/durable">Instructions are available on the library website</a>, or contact your <a href="http://library.citytech.cuny.edu/instruction/subjectSpecialists.php">library subject specialist</a> for more information.</li>
 	<li>We are exploring solutions for password-protecting files on individual pages and posts for public sites, but for now pages and posts on a public site are not a secure place for files you would like password-protected, unless the site is private. If your site is public, we advise that you use Dropbox or another external file sharing site until we find a solution.  If your course or project profile is private, you can also use the Files area.</li>
 	<li>According to <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/fair-use-faq">fair use</a> guidelines, you may post parts of creative works–for example music, video, or images–in order to comment on or critique them as long as you give credit to the author and do not post the entire work.</li>
 	<li>It is always best to embed video from another site, such as YouTube or Vimeo. These sites do their best to make sure their content adheres to copyright rules. However, they can’t always check everything, so use your best judgement and don’t embed anything you know or suspect infringes on copyright.
<ul>
 	<li>When using images that are not yours:
<ul>
 	<li>Use open license images, such as those licensed through <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons</a>. You may use these as long as you credit the original owner or creator of the image.</li>
 	<li>Try to find images that are in the public domain, which are free of copyright. In the U.S., images created before 1923 are automatically in the public domain.</li>
 	<li>Find out whether you have permission to use an image. If it says “all rights reserved” or “copyright,” do not use. Or, if you can’t find any copyright information or if you’re unsure, it’s best not to use.</li>
 	<li>Read our help page on <a href="https://multi.openlab.dev/blog/help/following-copyright-guidelines-for-images/">images</a> for more information, including where you can find open license and public domain images.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>You can also link to a website, text, image, video, or music; again, it’s best not to link to something you know is infringing on copyright.</li>
</ul>
