In addition to adding individual images to a post or page, you can also add an image gallery.

1. From the Edit Post or Page screen, put your cursor where you would like to add the image gallery, and click the <b>Add Media</b> button.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-8173 size-full" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_1.png" sizes="(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px" srcset="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_1.png 957w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_1-300x107.png 300w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_1-32x11.png 32w" alt="Add media screenshot" />

2. Click <b>Create Gallery</b> on the left-hand side of the next page (see below).  You can either choose images that you’ve already uploaded to your Media Library, or you can upload new files.  Depending on which option you want, click on either the <b>Upload Files</b> or <b>Media Library</b> tab.

3. Choose the files you would like to add to the gallery.  When you’re finished, click <b>Create a new gallery</b> in the bottom right-hand corner.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-8174 size-large" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_2-1024x516.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_2-1024x516.png 1024w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_2-300x151.png 300w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_2-32x16.png 32w, https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Image_Gallery_2.png 1200w" alt="Create gallery screenshot" />

4. Next, edit the gallery.  You may add captions to your images, drag and drop to change the order of the images, change the number of columns that will appear in the gallery, or add additional images to the gallery.  When you’re finished, click <b>Insert gallery</b> in the bottom right-hand corner.

5. The image gallery will appear as a dotted gray box in the post or page editor.  If you need to edit the gallery, click on the gray box, and then click on the icon with the camera (see image below).

6. When you’re finished, <b>Publish</b> your post or page, and the image gallery will appear in your post or page similar to what is pictured below.
