This post should display a <a title="Featured Images" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/featured-images/#setting-a-featured-image" target="_blank">featured image</a>, if the theme <a title="Post Thumbnails" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails" target="_blank">supports it</a>.

Non-square images can provide some unique styling issues.

This post tests a vertical featured image.
